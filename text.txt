Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.

way to run JavaScript outside of a browser. When we write a backend server and database, Node.js is a popular choice because we
can run our code as a standalone application rather than something that can only be evaluated in a browser environment.
Node.js is an important tool for any JavaScript developer to understand. So, today, weâ€™ll introduce you to Node.js and 
show you how to get started with a project.
